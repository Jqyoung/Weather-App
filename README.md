# Weather-App

A weather application that displays real-time weather, weather in the next 24 hours as well as weather in the next 3 days based on the location user enters. It is a project from [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

- A carousel or slider display for the hourly weather forecast with arrows and navigation circles.
- Display more information for the current weather such as wind speed, etc.

## Things I Learned

- Asynchronous JavaScript concepts such as event-loop and promises.
- Working with external APIs asynchronously using fetch function, promises, async and await.
- Implement MVC(Model-View-Controller) design pattern effectively.
- Arrow function "this" context is inherited from the parent scope at where the function is defined and the context will not change.
- Using Map data structure to store and organize data.
